# Personal-Blog
This project is a simple personal blog application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create blog posts through a form on the landing page (index.html), store them locally using localStorage, and view them on a separate posts page (blog.html). The application supports light and dark mode themes and includes basic navigation between the form and posts pages.
